Oergeli-Simulator
=================

Cocoa app that turns keyboard into the right-hand melody side of a schwyzer√∂rgeli.  Only does either push or pull at a time.  Using a Leap Motion controller, the screen's movement can be tracked to determine whether the app should play a push or pull note for a button pressed.
